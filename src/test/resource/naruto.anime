               </div>Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description">Naruto Uzumaki, a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja, lives in Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf village. Moments prior to his birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the 4th Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto. <br> <br> Shunned because of the presence of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village. He strives to become the Hokage of Konohagakure, and he meets many friends and foes along the way. <br> <br> [Written by MAL Rewrite]</span><h2 style="margin-top: 15px;">

                </div>To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.
                <br> 
                <br> The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and 
                <span style="display: none;" id="review4349">they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.<br> <br> The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). <br> <br> The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...<br> <br> Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. <br> <br> Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.<br> <br> Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description “average” to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.<br> <br> As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.<br> <br> The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.<br> <br> The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.<br> <br> That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. <br> <br> I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. <br> <br> Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.<br> <br> I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.<br> <br> Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I’ve heard it was much better… I really hope so!<br> <br> To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)</span>

                </div>I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers...
                <br> 
                <br> When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and 
                <span style="display: none;" id="review5805">loving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old.<br> <br> Then again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet.<br> <br> What I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens.<br> <br> All in all, it was a good show. Just good. So basically: Shame on those people who watch 10 episodes and immediately come here and write a review. Also shame on people who give this show all 1's because everyone else loves it. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.</span>

                </div>I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess "unadulterated" is a strong word but I digress..
                <br> 
                <br> In any case, before starting this review I want to point out that I haven't read the manga so I'm unsure as to what was or wasn't changed during the process of animating this story and I guess it's time to get the show on the road. 
                <br> 
                <br> *Also, let it be known that the infamous "Filler Arc" 
                <span style="display: none;" id="review36623">is not part of this review.<br> <br> Naruto is the story of a group of rookie ninja from Konoha (Leaf) Village, with particular focus on our title character Naruto Uzumaki and his two friends Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. The story starts soon after the three of them graduate from there Ninja Academy and are put under the care of Kakashi Hatake who, for the most part, takes on the standard role of the "mentor" who teaches them the value of teamwork and all that jazz.<br> <br> The main characters can apparently be hit or miss, though I liked them for the most part. Naruto himself seems to follow in the footsteps of Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, though I personally don't consider him anywhere near as dense and also don't consider him an "idiot" like most people tend to.<br> <br> Sakura seems to get the most flack from my experience because, for the most part she plays the "useless female" role. The thing is, she herself realizes that and actively tries to change herself which makes for some interesting scenes down the road. <br> <br> Sasuke is probably the most intriguing of the main characters, simply because he himself admits that he is only training to "kill a certain man" and he and Naruto clash quite a few times over their belief systems, particularly in the oh so excellent final arc.<br> <br> As far as Kakashi, there isn't a whole lot to say as he reveals very few nuggets of information about himself. He's a cool guy, but he's very much a supporting character during this series.<br> <br> But, to be honest, the thing that Naruto can be proud of is the excellent cast of supporting characters. From the intelligent, yet lethargic Shikamaru to the Bruce Lee wanna be Rock Lee it's pretty cool to see all these different characters, who usually have a very interesting and unique fighting style, clash with one another. <br> <br> It also should be mentioned that a certain villain, Orochimaru, who appears rather frequently is a scene stealer and takes part in some of the more memorable moments of this series. It's also when he appears that the show really takes off and gets interesting, as he is the instigator of some of the biggest plot points. His personality and his willingness to use any and all means to further himself and his power is interesting and very often disturbing.<br> <br> One thing that is important throughout the series is the running theme of revenge and human relations. Every one, from Gaara to Sasuke to Naruto himself has had some sort of bad experience during their childhood and it seems as though "friendship overcoming tragedy" is maybe the predominate theme throughout the show. <br> <br> Now this series being a shounen, it's obvious it has pacing flaws here and there. For example, many of the fight scenes are dragged out to an annoying degree. And this is very apparent in the first arc when the characters go through two separate fight scenes that both take at the very least three or four episodes each, which isn't a huge problem if you marathon the series like I did. But, it still deserves mentioning as it is annoying.<br> <br> The plus side is that most fight scenes, particularly during the Chuunin Exam arc and beyond, are very well animated and just overall well done. The aforementioned Shikamaru for example has some of the more noteworthy scenes because he uses his head, instead of any physical abilities, and his fight scenes are always damn good fun.<br> <br> But, this also highlights one of the issues I do have with the fight scenes and, even though this is a problem with shounen action anime in general, it's especially bothersome here. The characters have a habit of explaining everything they do to their enemy which would be time better spent actually defeating your opponent rather than telling them your skills. I know it's just so the mangaka can flex his thought process and the logic behind the attacks to the viewer but..it's still kind of tiresome and could certainly be implemented better.<br> <br> I think the music bears mentioning as I thought it was either great, such as most of the music used during the dramatic scenes and some battle scenes, or forgettable, which is pretty much the rest of the fight scene music. <br> <br> The Japanese voice actors did a great job imo, especially during some of the more serious scenes. But, I especially got to shout out to the multiple voices for Orochimaru. Of which almost all of them are suitably creepy and, even though they sound different, they still manage to pull off the basic speech patterns. <br> <br> In Summary:<br> <br> Story: 7<br> It takes a while for things to really get going, but once it does you'll notice it. Unfortunately for some, the pacing can sometimes be broken by the short training arcs which are actually pretty entertaining and in many cases are segued in nicely with the story arcs. Also, there is only one short filler arc throughout the first 135 episodes.<br> <br> Art: 8<br> First off, it should be apparent from our protagonists conspicuous appearance that, in many ways these guys are ninjas in name only. Still, the appearances of the characters throughout the series are so varied that I, at the very least, didn't care. Animation does take a dip occasionally, however.<br> <br> Sound: 8<br> Orochimaru is a plus, no doubt about that. And most of the other cast members have good voice acting, though Rock Lee's can sometimes be grating.. The music is pretty good, though occasionally generic.<br> <br> Character: 8<br> Depending on how you take to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura this could be your favorite part of the series, which is the case for me, or your least favorite, and probably game breaking, aspect of the series as it does depend upon these three for the vast majority of the story . But, I'm sure most people will like the supporting characters as almost all of them are developed to a satisfying degree. Unfortunately, all of them fit the tragic past stereotype so...your mileage may vary. You may want to avoid this series if you aren't a fan of melodrama.<br> <br> Enjoyment: 9<br> Hell yeah, I enjoyed this series. I won't lie, I loved this series. But, it certainly isn't for everyone and I can understand quite a few people being frustrated by this shows some times slow, often times fast pacing and some of the more dragged out arcs even frustrated me at times. Also, as I said before, enjoyment largely hinges on whether or not you take to the three main characters or not. <br> <br> Overall: 8<br> To sum it up, don't go into Naruto expecting to see the tightest script ever written or anything thought provoking. Just go into it for a fun time and, maybe, you'll be surprised by the well developed characters like I was. Make no mistake, Naruto was a great experience for me..especially because I went into the series expecting it to be terrible and, by the time I realized it wasn't, I was enjoying the ride. <br> <br> *If you want to make any sort of comment, just drop by my profile. Criticism is welcome as this is my first review in quite a while and I went with a different style than I have in the past. Thanks for reading this review, I hope it helps anyone interested in this series.</span>

                <br> 
                <br> In either case, there are few anime out there that evoke a visceral reaction like Naruto. Sure there is Inuyasha and you can get your eyes clawed out by yaoi fangirls for calling them closet lesbians, but no other anime has started a craze of shut ins wearing orange sweatsuits and headbands to school like Naruto. 
                <br> 
                <br> See, a uniform code is not just for keeping Crips and Bloods from wearing gang colors to school.
                <br> 
                <br> Naruto 
                <span style="display: none;" id="review15590">is about a Ninja named Eddie. No, he's named Naruto. He lives in a village where some great Ninja master gave his life to entrap an alien parasite into a carrier queen, I mean a Demon Fox into a baby's body. That baby is Naruto, a completely useless ninja who can summon the great power of the fox within. Think of him like a impish Goku, or maybe Ichigo--I don't know. Anime that go on forever all blend in for me.<br> <br> What is this all about, well it's the typical drawn out storyboard of characters growing up and becoming ninja. Doing Ninja missions (which are filler episodes) while the story dances around the plot that Sasuke is some talented Ninja with a traitor dick of a brother, some girl called Sakura, some short quiet Rei-clone of a girl whose name escapes me but I keep running into on gelbooru, and a sensei who loves kancho--but in the English dub the delightful Japanese pasttime of poking someone's asshole in a nonsexual way with your index finger is clearly unacceptable and heavily edited.<br> <br> Honestly there is no plot. Naruto is a loser, but he has a great power and a lot of the show is geared around how he takes a beating but when he unleashes that power, it is maximum. There's some effeminate snake ninja who plots to get revenge on the leaf village, molests Sasuke, gets pwnt only to return over and over again, there's Sakura being split whether to spread her legs for Sasuke or Naruto--but settling for some old woman instead.<br> <br> This is your typical cliffhanger anime where you watch someone power up or prepare to unleash an ultimate technique for 20 minutes, then are forced to watch a filler episode before you see the obvious, with plot twists usually being mundane like "the ninja training exam has been hijacked, oh noes!" With that said, you'd think with over 200 episodes they could develop the characters, but strangely these kind of anime seem to be unable to do that--instead of relying on stock characters that don't really change over time (well, they can become more moody, evil, or slutty--but that isn't a dramatic and shattering change).<br> <br> I just have to concede that I don't understand this. And I also have to concede that I don't like this. Good drama and fiction doesn't spread itself so thin, becoming hopelessly lost in itself.<br> <br> Also, for the love of God, don't dress up as Naruto.<br> <br> Just don't.</span>

                      If you can replace Pirates with Ninjas and vice versa, Naruto and One Piece are a lot alike with the exception of art.

                      These are both huge battle anime, where the main characters both have a huge goal, Luffy wants to find One Piece and become the Pirate King, and Naruto wants to become the best Hokage ever. Also, at the beginning of the series, Naruto and Luffy are very alike, causing mischief as they go along. Even though Luffy hasn't changed that much over all these years, Naruto has matured way more and has become more serious, now that the series is nearing it's climax.&nbsp;

                      <br> In both anime very interesting abilities of heroes, their characters, charisma. And as the important place is borrowed with friendship and fidelity.
                      <br> At both anime as there is a lot of humour, the cat well dilutes many heavy situations occuring during adventures

                      Shounen, action, adventure manga, both with a main character who wants to fulfill their dreams. Both of them have many special combat elements and a similiar story line as getting new friends, win against enemys, some drama sequence etc.
                      <br> All in all I find that One Piece stands more out, but give Naruto a try!

                      Luffy is very similiar to Naruto. They´re both really childish characters with the biggest dream in mind.

                      Both have a main character that gets stronger throughout the story. Both main characters are sort of idiots. Both main characters fight to protect their comrades. There is a lot of comedy, and the fighting scenes revolve around honor and doing the right thing.
                      <br> 
                      <br> One piece is about pirates, and Naruto is about ninjas. They are both extremely long running, and they are both "gateway" anime. If you love one, then you typically will love the other one in my experience.
                      <br> 
                      <br> Both are unique in a lot of ways, and both are heavily inspired by Dragon Ball.&nbsp;

                      First of all, I started to watch both anime because of their first endings. Naruto ending is incredibly true&amp;sad at the same time, even if - at the first sight - the story doeasn't look very smart it's deeper then you think - just watch first two seasons! One Piece first ending I also liked because of the song (it's catchy).
                      <br> On the other hand it's easier to start watching One piece than Naruto, because like I said before, Naruto's story at the beginning looks pretty dumb. Much dumber than One Piece's ;D
                      <br> BUT I like both these anime :) (much more Naruto &lt;3)&nbsp;

                      Kind of common sense really.Along with a few other anime Naruto and One piece would be considered 2 of the 5 kings of long running anime. And by long running i mean 100 or so episodes. Anyway both anime are very similar in characters however luffy is strong but stubborn however Naruto acts dumb but when in tough situations he is quite the tactician. I'm one of those people who never really liked anime's such as death note. So yeah, it should be easy to fall in love with both anime. I will sow this however, both anime have a story which i would consider 
                      <span style="display: none;" id="recommend78429">unique and leave others in the dust. Naruto may seem boring to others however it's watchable in my opinion. Where as one piece is always a laugh.</span>&nbsp;

                      The genres are quite alike, and they are universes where fighting is necessary for surivival. Where Naruto is more about emotions and the craft of a fictive universe, Bleach presents more extreme fighting scenes with a stench of Dragon Ball in it. Both are great animes.&nbsp;

                      Both main characters have powers and a strong willed mind. They never give up and fight mainly for the sake of their friends (I've just described the shounen genre). Both develop their powers throughout the anime as they keep training and fighting. One as a substitute shinigami and the other one as a ninja. The cast of Bleach is older than Naruto's but the target audience is not very different so if you've watched one and are looking for something with the same feel to it, give the other a go.&nbsp;

                      Let's start by comparing the story, both have similar shounen elements of that fighting spirit; Bleach = spiritual energy and Naruto = chakra. The Story's main protagonist seeks to become stronger after each encounter to protect their families (although in the beginning Naruto's motive is to not be seen as an outcast) The development of the protagonist is conveyed in a simple formula of finding that inner strength to overcome their opponent (speaking which both suffer inner demons to which they must also struggle against and control to unleash their full potential), however this simple formula is made entertaining by the interactions with a long 
                      <span style="display: none;" id="recommend84505">list of supporting characters and the choreography of the fight scenes.<br> <br> The OST is probably the most outstanding feature of both Naruto and Bleach. They both evoke this primal instinct to fight and be poised for a fight (also evident through their extensive training regimes). It's heart pounding and raises the tension/excitement factor to set the scene for some epic shounen battles. The fight/battle scenes are generally dragged out to showcase both the parties moves and special abilities but also act as its foundation to the plot. (i.e. introducing new abilities, developing new abilities or creating plot points)<br> <br> The animation is solid throughout both shows, especially considering both shows' length. It certainly will not be a deterrent. However, one point to note is the amount of fillers may be an issue for a lot of viewers, to overcome this issue, I recommend seeking some great filler guides on the internet to watch the show in its canon form especially if the filler is not to your liking. </span>&nbsp;

                      Both talk a lot about friendship as being important, the action is also similar. Naruto is more dramatic than fairy tail though, but fairy tail makes up for this by being hilarious XD. Both are also must sees in the anime world no matter what genre you're into, to be honest if you watch anime you probably know what Naruto is anyway lol, but still Fairy Tail, in my opinion is equally as awesome!&nbsp;

Even to the point of giving themselves up to the people chasing them. Though Nabari no Ou is shorter than Naruto they both show that they get stronger to protect themselves and the ones around them.

                      The art style for Soul Eater actually is rather similar to Naruto's in the fact that it uses rather thick lines and bright, solid colours. Even the tone of the anime is similar, adding light-hearted and funny moments in-between epic action. Soul Eater injects a bit more humour than Naruto, but they both do a good job of relieving tension with humour at the right moments. Both anime focus on building up the quirky characters (which are very lovable and memorable) as they progress further into their world and as they get into more fights. Both stories are essentially following the

                      Naruto relates to the character Black Star in Soul Eater very much(as mentioned by others)--the difference is that Black Star is much cooler(IMO).
                      <br> 
                      <br> Both animes have a similar relation with the characters being mediocre at first and eventually grow stronger. Soul Eater however is fairly more organized in episodes and actually has an ending(also, it didn't exceed over 100 episodes!). 
                      <br> 
                      <br> There's lots of your humour and action just like Naruto too.

                      There are a lot of resemblances between the two. Some of the main characters are like main characters from Naruto. Me and my friend joke around and try to assign a Soul Eater character to a Naruto character. So far we have matched Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, Kabuto, Orchimaru, and the Mizukage. &nbsp;

                      In the same way that HxH was deeply inspired by Dragonball, Naruto is deeply inspired by HxH. For one, both series make their money from their attachable characters and bright outdoor style. Second, many plot element from Naruto are almost simply ripped off HxH (chuunin exam and hunter exam, chakra abilities taken from a nen ability - the puppeteer for instance). 
                      <br> However, just as HxH was more serious than DB, dropping a lot of the humour for more daunting psychological trauma, Naruto pushes that further to the point of sounding emo at time. Yet, overall, it remains light. &nbsp;
