                 </div>Before you read this. If you don't like manga that takes a long time to finish up plots then this manga isn't for you. If you do then keep reading.
                 <br> 
                 <br> First off, the story is very well written, but as I said before, it takes a long time to finish up a plot. There are enough plot twists to keep you guessing, but I wouldn't say there are a bunch of them. Because of this, the story gets a 9/10. If the plots were sped up by a slight bit, it would be perfect.
                 <br> 
                 <br> Next is the art. This style is 
                 <span style="display: none;" id="review1025">perfect for a ninja manga. It shows detail to what's important, not just what's in the panel. I've seen many manga detail every last thing in each panel, which looked nice, but it drew attention away from what's really important. The character design is nothing to scoff at either. 10/10<br> <br> The characters in this manga are very well thought out. Almost every character either has or will have a backstory. One character has no real backstory until you get to the late 300's. Unlike many manga, everyone has a unique look and personality. There are very few exceptions to this i.e. Rock Lee and Gai.<br> <br> To put it simply. I like this manga for what it is. My only concern is the speed of the storyline. Personally, I'd give it a 9.5/10. I hope you found this review helpful.</span>

                 </div>This review contains spoilers up to chapter 435 of the Naruto manga. Read at your own risk.
                 <br> 
                 <br> 
                 <br> Naruto is currently one of the leading titans of the anime industry, and probably the biggest thing to hit it off stateside since Dragonball Z. At first glance, you would think it is completely deserved, and rightly so. After all, this series has all the components of a major success. Nice art? Check. Interesting-looking characters? Check. Unique and clever fighting styles? Why yes. And don't forget the ninjas. After all, what's cooler than ninjas?
                 <br> 
                 <br> Unfortunately, none of that means jack squat if it isn't executed correctly. This is where Naruto 
                 <span style="display: none;" id="review12472">falls flat on its face.<br> <br> The story is typical shonen fare, a young boy hated by his peers sets off to prove himself useful. I won't go into detail as to why, since MAL's Naruto page covers that quite nicely. The problem here is that said boy is set up as almost instantly unlikeable. He's a juvenile delinquent with low motivations, low intelligence, low skill and pie-in-the-sky dreams. Soon after the start of the series, he gets teamed up with Sasuke Uchiha, a mildly interesting lad with murderous feelings toward his own brother, Sakura Haruno, whose personality can best be described as "only there to be a gushing Sasuke fangirl," and Kakashi Hatake, their adult leader who is cool, lazy and just about the only interesting thing about this group.<br> <br> I will admit that the first few arcs are actually kind of neat. Pretty darn enjoyable, actually. Masashi Kishimoto had talent back in those days, and it shows. the Zabuza arc, for example, is going to grab you and take you along for the ride all the way through. Most of the others after that are also kind of fun, up until after the Chuunin exams.<br> <br> One of the best parts about this series early on is its wide, diverse and interesting cast of minor supporting characters. They all have their own hopes and dreams, and every single one of them has an interesting fighting style. For example, there's Rock Lee, a martial artist and the only ninja in the village who has no need for fireballs and shuriken, Neji Hyuuga, a child prodigy who aims for the weak spots, Kiba Inuzuka, who teams up with his pet dog in battle, Gaara, who controls and manipulates sand in battle, and Tenten, who....<br> <br> Oh, damn. What does she do? Something to do with weapons.<br> <br> Oh, well. She's basically a throwaway character. Kishimoto invented her to keep the "two guys and a girl" status quo he had going. She barely gets any screentime and says all of three or so lines in the entire series, which is a damn shame. She has a very neat character design.<br> <br> Anyway, most of the side characters are fantastic, and they all get some screentime to show off their unique abilities.<br> <br> Until after the Chuunin exams.<br> <br> Now to be a little more fair, there is an arc right after the Chuunin exams that gets them all an excuse to play around with their powers and provides a decent amount of entertainment. Unfortunately, I have to call that the beginning of the rot anyway, because that is the point where the series takes a gigantic nosedive. And that nosedive's name is Sasuke.<br> <br> Yes, Sasuke. The mildly interesting young fellow goes from being kind of cool to being an overpowered wristcutter with all the personality of a chunk of cardboard. In his quest for power, which he plans to use to murder his own sibling, he enters the tutelage of a fifty-something Michael Jackson impersonator with a bizarre snake affinity, betrays his friends, and generally acts like an utter moron. Worse yet, the story shifts its focus from a balance of all the fantastic side characters to this emo Mary Sue punk. At certain points, you might as well just call the series Sasuke. At one point, he manages to actually kill his brother, only to find out that Itachi threw the match. What's more, Itachi was dying anyway and only ever had the best intentions at heart, giving his life to protect his home. Sasuke then immediately decides to destroy said village, which makes no sense no matter how you look at it.<br> <br> Compounding on that dilemma is the story's pacing, which more or less comes to a grinding halt. Fights suddenly begin to drag on chapter after chapter, villains become dull and unmotivated, and characters become dumber and dumber as the plot demands.<br> <br> The most recent arc involves Naruto's final showdown with Pein, an elite warlord superninja with six individually sentient bodies and a knack for showy, destructive rampages. Though there were quite a few clever developments, such as Naruto's most recent powerups and development from whiny brat to competent, clever tactician, this arc suffers greatly from many side character-related flaws. Kishimoto has begun to kill off Naruto's mentors left and right for no apparent reason and in completely embarrassing ways. For example, Kakashi, the coolest thing this series had going for it since the Zabuza Arc, recently died of exaustion after failing to do any significant damage to one of Pein's bodies. Meanwhile, halfway across town, a young, weak Naruto wannabe named Konohamaru knocks out another of Pein's bodies in one blow. What's more, people began to acknowledge Naruto as their only chance for salvation long before he arrived at the village, despite the fact that he had previously done absolutely nothing to deserve that kind of respect. As of the current chapter, the minor characters who were once so clever, imaginative and fun to watch are basically sitting around muttering about how they'll only get in the way of this person that's fighting the ultimate enemy of their entire village, despite the fact that said person was until very recently regarded as the village idiot.<br> <br> These ratings are generous due to the beginning of the series. Back then Charactes would have gotten a perfect ten. Now they barely deserve a two thanks to all the derailment. The story, once at least an eight, has now puttered down to no more than a one. The enjoyment rating is only as high as it is because this series is almost fun to read if only to laugh at Kishimoto's desperate attempts to motivate a character that's already got more than enough motivation, thanks, and to observe how very, very tired of this series he obviously is. The only reason I can fathom for him to continue is because his editor wants to milk this franchise for all it's worth, rather than risk starting over with a newer, more interesting franchise. I only continue it in the shallow hope that it may one day become half as great as it once was.<br> <br> In conclusion, Naruto starts out great, but crashes like Michael Scott from The Office on sugar. It hasn't regained its boundless energy yet, and it's likely to keep sleeping for a while. There is much, much better out there, people. Please try to broaden your horizons.</span>

                 </div>The world of Naruto is probably the most interesting aspect of the show. Despite being a show about ninja, the soldiers in this manga are really ninja in name only. They're actually much more reminiscent of modern soldiers with flashy ninja magic than mysterious, stealthy ninja.
                 <br> 
                 <br> There characters are a rather nice aspect of the show. Many of them are archetypes, but I find them entertaining regardless. I also feel like the characters that are around Naruto's age (teenagers) have realistic personalities. They're teenagers, and they act like teenagers. That's one of the reasons I like them. Many would disagree with me, so it's really a 
                 <span style="display: none;" id="review2012">matter of taste and perspective.<br> <br> The action scenes are rather exciting, but there certainly is better out there. The characters have a variety of different ways in which they do battle, and some styles are very entertaining. Others seems utterly ridiculous and completely out of place in a manga that's trying to be serious.<br> <br> Now, while the series certainly has it's good aspects, the overall series is something worse than the sum of its parts. In fact, while Kishimoto clearly knows what he's doing from an artistic standpoint, his lack of story-telling skills shows through. He spends far too much time putting focus on minor characters. There ends up being so little focus on Naruto himself that it's almost impossible to feel any attachment toward him. I also find him to be rather annoying, which makes it even more difficult to feel for him.<br> <br> Furthermore, he only focuses on one character at a time. He seems incapable of putting the focus on a group of characters, as he should. Even when the characters are together, they only seem to speak to one another when necessary, never saying much more than what's needed. So while the characters themselves are decent, the character interactions are not very well done.<br> <br> The story also seems to get side-tracked quite often. Some story arcs have very little to do with the main story at all. Now, that wouldn't be such a problem, but a few of these story arcs each span over a few volumes. A lot of the time, it feels like a waste of time.<br> <br> The art is quite good, but Kishimoto actually has a tendancy to show too much detail. He shows far more than what's necessary, taking up panels, taking up pages, and slowing down the progress of the manga.<br> <br> The slow progress is the final nail in the coffin. The longer the series goes, the more it's flaws stand out. The series is good, but not good enough to justify the long, tedious progression of events.<br> <br> Personally, I love this series. However, I have to admit that, looking at it from a critical standpoint, most aspects of this manga are so utterly mediocre that the series ends up looking even worse than it is.<br> <br> On a final note, I'd like to say that when I read the manga in graphic novel format, as opposed to the one chapter per week format it's released in Japan and on the internet, I found the series to be much more enjoyable. This makes the series far less tedious, since many events are experienced in one sitting, since an entire chapter can--and often does--revolve around one minute event. Even the English release in the American Shonen Jump, which is released monthly, four chapters are released all at once, making it a much more satisfying read.<br> <br> So, I would suggest either buying the graphic novels or Shonen Jump, or just waiting for the chapters online to build up, and read them about once a month instead of reading the latest one every week. This will make for a much more enjoyable reading experience.</span>

                 </div>Note: This review was created for the recently released Vol. 1-27 box set. I'm posting it here because, as you can probably guess by its length, it covers more than just a brief description of the box and what's inside. :)
                 <br> 
                 <br> Note 2: The 9/10 score is for Vol. 1-27 only. In my opinion, the series drops in quality by a huge amount in the last half and we'd be talking 6-7/10 if I rated Vol. 28 onwards. Naruto is difficult to rate when I love the first half so much...
                 <br> 
                 <br> ----------------
                 <br> 
                 <br> Naruto is a name that brings lots of memories to the front of my mind. Many 
                 <span style="display: none;" id="review7557">years ago, when I was 14-15 and hadn't watched anime for very long, I was told about this hugely popular title. Being new to anime at the time, discovering I had 60-80 episodes to watch before I'd catch up wasn't a worry; discovering Naruto's a lengthy story actually made me even more eager to catch up. I caught up within a week, finding myself addicted to it, the weekly episodes working as a sort of drug that kept me going until the next episode aired.<br> <br> ...But, sadly, nothing in life lasts forever. The Naruto anime eventually ended up becoming a joke after the first 135 episodes due to the anime evil known as 'filler'; original stories the animation studio come up with when they run out of manga material to animate. Older Naruto anime fans had to endure nearly two years of soul destroying stories, involving cooking ninja, postmen ninja and a Tony the Tiger lookalike. And when the anime finally started to follow the real plot again, a combination of budget cuts and laziness meant it just wasn't enjoyable to watch any more.<br> <br> After enduring so much, I decided that reading black and white pages to finish the story would be far more enjoyable than continuing to watch the anime adaptation. From that point onwards I've followed the manga instead of the anime weekly, starting from the point where the proper anime story restarted after the two year filler hell. I didn't read the first 250 or so chapters that came before because I already knew the story and reading all those pages would've taken a long, long time.<br> <br> Now, as a Naruto fan, I'm sure you can imagine my joy a few weeks ago when I discovered a new Naruto Vol. 1-27 box set was just around the corner, it containing all the chapters I hadn't read. After being impressed with the box art images, I was fast to order when I saw that a store were selling it for £60; £2.23 per volume AND with a box to hold all 27 volumes - A bargain if there ever was one for an American import.<br> <br> When it arrived a few days after ordering my initial reaction wasn't pure joy. The box my set was packaged in (which had been used for both the journey from America and to me) had some damage to a corner and, sure enough, one of the corners of the set inside had taken a nasty knock. My anger was cooled by the store I purchased it from offering me a £18 refund on the day the set arrived, which I was quick to accept when the damage wasn't THAT bad and the volumes inside hadn't been damaged. I suppose it's hard not for such a heavy set to get damaged in some way when it travels such a long way...<br> <br> Forgetting about the damage, the box looks fantastic. On the front is a large image of Naruto (green background), on the right side is an odd(ish) looking image of Sasuke (orange background), on the left is a cute image of Sakura (yellow background) and the back of the box has a cool looking shot of a huge chunk of the cast together. Although it would've been nice to see the Vol. 26-27 cover art used instead, I can't see any Naruto fan disliking the box art; most I'm sure would be very satisfied. It's also worth mentioning that the set has a small handle on the top that allows you to move it around with ease.<br> <br> The box opens by pulling the right-hand side, that side being held by three velcro circles. Once inside, the 27 volumes are stacked on two blue shelves, with a small double-sided poster and booklet also included. Let me tell you, it's very pleasing on the eye for a Naruto fan to open the box and see the spines of 27 volumes, knowing they contain the best section of the Naruto story.<br> <br> The volumes themselves are great. For a weekly manga, the art is top class and, unlike in certain other series, it's very easy to follow the action. There are even some pages in-between the chapters used for Kishimoto's (the manga author) personal thoughts, including some interesting information such as who his favourite character is, what manga attempts he made before Naruto, how he let a plant die by doing something silly, etc. His comments are great for Naruto fans who want to know more about the man who created what they love.<br> <br> Overall, this set is truly wonderful and was created for fans who want to own the first half of the series in style. The only problem is the risk of it arriving damaged. You'd have to be a pretty damn lucky person for it not to have received at least some damage along the way.<br> <br> Moving on, with my brief Naruto history and box description covered, I'm going to try to quickly describe the actual story and express my feelings about it a little more.<br> <br> Naruto's a relatively simple story that steals from other famous shounen (young boy) series, namely Dragon Ball. In Naruto we, the readers, follow a young ninja called Naruto who has a big dream: he wants to become the Hokage; the champion/leader of his ninja village. This dream is not a very likely one when Naruto happens to have the lowest grade his class and be better known for being a trouble maker than being a skilled ninja.<br> <br> But, unknown even to Naruto, he has something special hidden inside him that sets him apart: Kyuubi (9-tails); the most deadly creature in existence that was sealed inside his newly born body as a last resort by the previous Hokage (at the cost of his life) when the Kyuubi attacked his ninja village (Konoha). Although a law was made preventing any of the adults revealing this afterwards, the adults hated Naruto because they saw him as the Kyuubi in a human form, and their hatred of him spread to their children even without them revealing the reasoning behind their feelings. This resulted in Naruto wanting to be respected, fuelling his dream to become the Hokage.<br> <br> Using that plot as its base, the story goes on from there, quickly developing by putting Naruto in a team with two other rookie ninja: Uchiha Sasuke (Naruto's skilled rival) and Sakura (the brightest girl ninja, who just so happens to have a crush on Sasuke and hates Naruto). All three are distinctive characters that keep the series interesting with their differences, the dialogue between the three never being dull.<br> <br> One last plot related matter worth mentioning is the manga/anime differences...or rather, the lack of. Some filler additions and less blood/gore aside, the story you see in Vol. 1-27 (excluding Kakashi Gaiden) and EP1-135 is practically identical. There wouldn't be much point seeing both if you wanted to see changes.<br> <br> Finally: My thoughts about Naruto...<br> <br> Aside from Naruto having some of the best fights ever, what makes it stand out from the crowd is the diverse cast of likeable characters and absorbing world. All too often with stories you find yourself disconnected, not caring about the supporting cast or surrounding world very much, but Kishimoto somehow managed to create a huge amount of characters and make most enjoyable to pass time watching. The length of the story obviously helped, with Kishimoto having a lot of time to develop the cast, but it was more to do with his ability to create charming characters than anything else.<br> <br> One of the accusations many throw at Naruto due to its worldwide popularity is that it's too simple. Sure, its story is simplistic and aimed at young/teenage boys, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the time of adults when the characters receive excellent development and there are adult themes used constantly (Naruto is, after all, set in a world where ninja kill other ninjas). Lots of grown men in their 20s admit to loving Naruto, and that's because it's the sort of story everyone can enjoy. Don't make the mistake of assuming that what's aimed at young boys in Japan is what's aimed at young boys elsewhere in the world - the Japanese aren't as overly protective as people in most other countries.<br> <br> ...Well, I think that's about it. I hope this wall of text helps at least someone!</span>

                      the art is very similair to naruto, but is influcened by another aspects. It kinda looks like hunter x hunter/one piece/ naruto/dragonball. The hero is a young boy possessed by a great demon, just llike in naruto. They even have the same face expressions, though ruby the girl doesn't look like a naruto character. If you like naruto then 666 satan is a good manga for you, though naruto is much more complexed. 666satan has more action in the beginning, but naruto makes it up after the sasuke pursue arc. Final just read it kyoha&nbsp;

                       Made by two twins these mangas are similar in both ways. Firstly they deal with some fantasy worlds created by their authors, secondly main characters in those mangas has some evil creatures bounded with the main hero, thirdly almost the same time skip usage...

                       It's similar is that they both have the main character containing a monster in them, which they learn to semi-control for their own benefit. It does differ from naruto tho, although I still prefer it too naruto as many would agree :D&nbsp;

                       Naruto and 666 Satan are very similar. Both the art style, and the adventures that the main characters go on, as well as the special abilities they possess, make the protagonists of both manga very similar, as well as captivating. In addition, both have suffered from a difficult past, but currently hold a positive outlook on life as they both aim for their goals and dreams. Both are very entertaining, and if you like one, you almost defiantly will like the other. =)

                       If you liked 666 Satan, then you would surely like Naruto. After all, the plotlines and the art is so similar, yet somewhat different. Whilst 666 Satan deals with Angels and Demons, Naruto has Jinchuuriki, who is a person who has a tailed beast sealed within him/her. Also, the main characters of both series are pretty much the same person with subtle differences. They are both alone from the beginning and strive for attention, but as time passes they change to strong, caring (and idiotic) leaders.&nbsp;

                       I'll start by saying that fans of these series go back and forth arguing which is better. They are both different in that Naruto is about Ninjas and One Piece is about Pirates. They both have a main character that is kind of an idiot, gets stronger as the story goes on, defeats many opponents he has no business even fighting and so much more. Both are heavily themed about comradery and how important it is to have "nakama" you care for and take care of.

                       <span style="display: none;" id="recommend23407">obsession of Naruto I eventually came upon One Piece. Though it starts out as a fun little adventure story (not quite as strong in the beginning as Naruto), it becomes an amazingly epic adventure that surpasses Naruto in many many ways. Most importantly, the delivery week to week is far superior. The overall story is greater imo. However, these 2 are at the top of my Wednesday reading schedule. These 2 are the ones I am collecting volumes on before all others. Don't compare these 2, just read and enjoy. They are different yet the same and they are both amazing in their own ways.</span>&nbsp;

                       Out of all the current manga and anime, Hunter x Hunter is definitely the most similar one to Naruto. They may give off different vibes but both their content is extremely similar. For one, both main characters start off at the age of 12 years old and have similar characteristics such as a super strong resolve and also having the power to change people or make people believe in them. Both mangas have a character who is the last member of their clan and also want revenge on the person who did it and their eyes also turn red. There's also a character who leaves 
                       <span style="display: none;" id="recommend12959">after making friends with the main character and this character is also a childhood prodigy(in different ways) and also uses the lightning element. Both have Exams for their occupation; in naruto it's the chunin exams while in HxH it's the hunter exams. The content of some of the exams are also similar to each other. You also have a creepy main villain who appear during the exams: HxH has Hisoka and Naruto has Orochimaru. Chakra, main source of energy and power in Naruto, is like that of Nen, main source of energy and power in Hunter X Hunter. Both series has a strong old lady who makes herself look younger. Ways of identifying their nen and chakra elements are also extremely similar as well. *note Hunter x Hunter was published first*. </span>&nbsp;
